# [Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS)](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.Y9dkm3ZBy3A)

The filename identifiers as per the official RAVDESS website:
* Modality (01 = full-AV, 02 = video-only, 03 = audio-only).
* Vocal channel (01 = speech, 02 = song).
* Emotion (01 = neutral, 02 = calm, 03 = happy, 04 = sad, 05 = angry, 06 = fearful, 07 = disgust, 08 = surprised).
* Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the 'neutral' emotion.
* Statement (01 = "Kids are talking by the door", 02 = "Dogs are sitting by the door").
* Repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd repetition).
* Actor (01 to 24. Odd numbered actors are male, even numbered actors are female).

So, here's an example of an audio filename. 02-01-06-01-02-01-12.mp4  
This means the meta data for the audio file is:
* Video-only (02)
* Speech (01)
* Fearful (06)
* Normal intensity (01)
* Statement "dogs" (02)
* 1st Repetition (01)
* 12th Actor (12) - Female (as the actor ID number is even)

# [Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion (SAVEE)](http://kahlan.eps.surrey.ac.uk/savee/Database.html)

# [Berlin Database of Emotional Speech (EMODB)](http://emodb.bilderbar.info/docu/)

Every utterance is named according to the same scheme:

* Positions 1-2: number of speaker
* Positions 3-5: code for text
* Position 6: emotion (sorry, letter stands for german emotion word)
* Position 7: if there are more than two versions these are numbered a, b, c,....
